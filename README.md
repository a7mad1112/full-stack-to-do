# FULL-STACK-TODO

FTS-Task-To-Do is a simple and user-friendly full-stack application built with Node.js and React that provides users with a convenient way to manage their to-do list.

## Features
FTS-Task-To-Do comes with several helpful features, including:
- ### Accessibility
  FTS-Task-To-Do is designed with web accessibility guidelines and best practices in mind, making it accessible to users with disabilities.

- ### Dark/Light Mode
  Users can switch between dark and light mode according to their preferences.

- ### Today Tasks
  A section is dedicated to displaying tasks for the current day.

- ### Next Seven Days
  Users can view tasks scheduled for the next seven days.

- ### Task Priorities
  Each task has a level of priority that is displayed with a specific color on the left side of the task element.
  If the priority is none, there is no color or priority.

- ### Responsive Design
  The website is responsive and can be viewed on any screen size.

- ### Task Completion
  Tasks can be marked as completed or non-complete, and completed tasks are displayed at the bottom of the task list.

- ### Hosting
  The website is deployed using Netlify, making it easy to share and access online.

- ### Version Control
  The project is managed using Git and GitHub, allowing for better collaboration with others and keeping track of changes made to the code.

- ### Task Count
  A counter next to each section link shows the number of tasks in that section (Home, Today, Next 7 Days).

- ### Task Search
  A search input element allows users to search for specific tasks by name.
  Debounce is used to reduce the number of calls to the search function.

- ### Assignee
  Users can assign tasks to someone, and this is displayed on the UI.

- ### Modals
  Custom modals are used instead of libraries like Sweetalert, and Promises are used for the delete modal.
